## Getting Started with the CareCoord Backend

### Prerequisites

Before you begin using the app, you'll need to make sure you have the [current version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, as well as [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

You also will need to install the [Expo Go application](https://expo.dev/client) on your mobile device.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't cloned the CareCoord repo, do so now by entering the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://capstone-cs.eng.utah.edu/caretechers/caretechers.git`

Then, enter the directory that the mobile application's frontend is located in:

`cd caretechers/backend`

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Again, make sure you have Node.js installed (see Prerequisites section above).

Install dependencies by entering the following command in your terminal:

`npm install`

### Step 3: Start the backend development server

To start the development server, just type the singular command in your terminal below

`npm start`

Alternatively, you can run `make start` to run the backend server in a docker container.
